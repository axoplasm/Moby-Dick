Moby-Dick
=========

I can’t believe there isn’t already a project called “Moby-Dick.”

## *Moby-Dick, or, The Whale* 
##### by Herman Melville. 

I’m prettifying my favorite book about a supernatural fish<sup>1</sup>, one chapter at a time.

### Computerish stuff

The text in this project is written entirely in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) ([Github flavor](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)). 

Plain-text source file is `2701.txt`. Chapters converted to Markdown are in the `/chapters/` directory. 

I’m serving and rendering text locally using [Serve](http://get-serve.com) with Bluecloth translating the Markdown to HTML. I apply a modicum of markup locally with the stylesheets in the `/stylesheets/` directory. These stylsheets are generated by a single [SASS (scss)](http://sass-lang.com) file in the `/sass/` directory, as a standard (albeit minimalist) [Compass](http://compass-style.org) project. 

#### You don’t need any of that to read the text.
Just crack open the `*.md` files in your favorite text editor or a Markdown editor like [Mou](http://mouapp.com), and enjoy.
